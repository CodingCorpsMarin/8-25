Compentencies

Inheritance is when a child class “inherits” methods and attributes from a parent class, for example, a student is a person
Composition is when an object class contains many of another class, for example, a school has many students
Composition allows you to be more flexible in your code, your classes don’t have to follow strict rules
Inheritance, in contrast, brings more order to your code, so that your classes are organized and make more sense
Generally, we want to use composition over inheritance unless it’s a no-brainer


Applications
