Create a parent/child inheritance relationship:

class Person
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
     @name = name
  end
  
end

class Student < Person
  attr_accessor :school
  
  def initialize(name, school)
    super(school)
    @school = school
  end
  
end

Create some instances to test your relationship
