Create a parent/child inheritance relationship:

class Person
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
     @name = name
  end
  
end

class Student < Person
  attr_accessor :school
  
  def initialize(name, school)
    super(school)
    @school = school
  end
  
end

Create some instances to test your relationship

Now create a composition relationship: 

class Movement
  def run
    puts "running"
  end
  
  def crawl
    puts "crawling"
  end
end

class Baby
  def initialize
    @movement = Movement.new
  end
  
  def move
    @movement.crawl
  end
  
end

class Athlete
  def initialize
    @movement = Movement.new
  end
  
  def move
    @movement.run
  end

end

Test it out with some instances
